# Battleship
Code for the technical assignment from Flare

# Summary
This repository contains my solution for the Battleship technical assignment. When cloning this repository, my latest changes are in the develop branch, so please use that. 

The application is loosely written as a Micro Service, with an API controller entry point that interfaces with the game board. I have included a test project and a selection of tests for each function.

You should be able to run the application from the Visual Studio debugger, as well as debug through the Unit Tests.

Thanks for taking the time to review my solution.
